[code boilerplate and project originally outlined by Albers Uzila at https://levelup.gitconnected.com/8-simple-steps-to-build-your-first-streamlit-app-91fe7b3bef9e]

Basic streamlit operations through a math problem generator. This is a basic Streamlit program, which uses Pandas to convert CSV data (problems are written in LaTeX) into human readable data. This is a template for more complex programs, and I plan to make this code reusable by creating a class structure for page production, and I will be tying the project settings to a YAML file. I may switch from YAML to another format, namely TOML.

In case you do not know, Streamlit web programs are generally used to present data using Python as a backend. My dev environment has been Jupyter Lab and Notes over a controlled environment managed with Ananconda, with version control over the installable Github program for Windows. I use numpy and the decimal library to manipulate data.
In the near future, I will incorporate every data visualization possible, add more data sources, then manipulate/translate data.
I may switch from Jupyter to Visual Studio Code, where I can use some addons and Github from within the IDE.
